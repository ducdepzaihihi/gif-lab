       git-add - Add file contents to the index

SYNOPSIS
       git add [--verbose | -v] [--dry-run | -n] [--force | -f] [--interactive | -i] [--patch | -p]
                 [--edit | -e] [--[no-]all | --[no-]ignore-removal | [--update | -u]] [--sparse]
                 [--intent-to-add | -N] [--refresh] [--ignore-errors] [--ignore-missing] [--renormalize]
                 [--chmod=(+|-)x] [--pathspec-from-file=<file> [--pathspec-file-nul]]
                 [--] [<pathspec>...]

DESCRIPTION
       This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content
       staged for the next commit. It typically adds the current content of existing paths as a whole, but with some
       options it can also be used to add content with only part of the changes made to the working tree files applied,
       or remove paths that do not exist in the working tree anymore.

       The "index" holds a snapshot of the content of the working tree, and it is this snapshot that is taken as the
       contents of the next commit. Thus after making any changes to the working tree, and before running the commit
       command, you must use the add command to add any new or modified files to the index.

       This command can be performed multiple times before a commit. It only adds the content of the specified file(s)
       at the time the add command is run; if you want subsequent changes included in the next commit, then you must
       run git add again to add the new content to the index.

       The git status command can be used to obtain a summary of which files have changes that are staged for the next
       commit.

       The git add command will not add ignored files by default. If any ignored files were explicitly specified on the
       command line, git add will fail with a list of ignored files. Ignored files reached by directory recursion or
       filename globbing performed by Git (quote your globs before the shell) will be silently ignored. The git add
       command can be used to add ignored files with the -f (force) option.

       Please see git-commit(1) for alternative ways to add content to a commit.

OPTIONS
       <pathspec>...
           Files to add content from. Fileglobs (e.g.  *.c) can be given to add all matching files. Also a leading
           directory name (e.g.  dir to add dir/file1 and dir/file2) can be given to update the index to match the
           current state of the directory as a whole (e.g. specifying dir will record not just a file dir/file1
           modified in the working tree, a file dir/file2 added to the working tree, but also a file dir/file3 removed
           from the working tree). Note that older versions of Git used to ignore removed files; use --no-all option if
           you want to add modified or new files but ignore removed ones.

           For more details about the <pathspec> syntax, see the pathspec entry in gitglossary(7).

       -n, --dry-run
           Donâ€™t actually add the file(s), just show if they exist and/or will be ignored.
